I’m botbot! The friendly bot who loves to help. 

My role is to notify the relevant teams via their Slack channel whenever there is a service healthcheck failure. I used to be a star in my field, but now I face the challenge of being replaced by my friend AI. However, I don’t mind because I know I’m being upgraded to a better version.
